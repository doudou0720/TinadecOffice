# TinadecOffice Architecture

TinadecOffice is split into three product responsibilities:

- `src/TinadecCore`: portable C# Core framework and runtime. It owns agents, runs, task graphs, context packs, supervision, approvals, model routes, events, secrets, permissions, capability discovery, SQLite persistence, and **Agent Debug Studio tracing**.
- `gateway`: TinadecOffice Elysia BFF/API layer. It exposes `/api/v1/*` (including `/api/v1/debug/*`), OpenAPI docs at `/docs`, and proxies to the Core runtime.
- `apps/desktop`: TinadecOffice Desktop, built with Electron + Vue. The renderer receives only the `window.tinadec.*` preload API and talks to TinadecOffice over HTTP/SSE. Includes the **Agent Debug Studio** as a separate BrowserWindow.

Core is the only state authority. Gateway and Desktop must not keep session state, approval decisions, model routing state, tool policy state, or provider lifecycle state.

TinadecOffice intentionally studies sibling projects such as VS Code, Codex, t3code, OpenCode, OpenHarness, Open-ClaudeCode, openclaw, pi, DeepSeek-TUI, and The Zeroth Docs. The reference map in [`docs/reference-project-map.md`](reference-project-map.md) records what to absorb and what to reject so those influences strengthen, rather than flatten, the Core/Tool/Desktop split.

## Default Ports

- TinadecOffice Elysia API: `http://127.0.0.1:48730`
- TinadecCore runtime: `http://127.0.0.1:48731`
- Vite renderer: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

## Harness And Tool Layer APIs

Core owns the agent harness model and Tool-layer policy semantics. Gateway proxies these endpoints, and Desktop renders them without recomputing risk or provider-layer meaning.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/v1/harness/manifest` | Core-owned summary of planning/execution agent layers, canonical tool registry governance, Tool-layer providers, tool risk policy, and registered tool descriptors. |
| `GET /api/v1/tools` | Raw Core tool descriptor list. |
| `GET /api/v1/tools/search` | Core-owned searchable tool discovery with matched metadata fields, provider layer, score, and human-checkpoint summary. Supports `query`, `domain`, `source`, `risk`, and `limit`. |
| `GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/tool-executions` | Core-owned tool execution timeline built from tool execution events, provider descriptors, checkpoint summaries, durations, and step-result evidence. Supports `runId` and `limit`. |
| `GET /api/v1/readiness` | Core-owned runtime readiness receipt covering SQLite storage, dual agent layers, canonical tool registry, model routes/providers, and extension runtime registries. Gateway/Desktop must proxy or display it without recomputing the status. |
| `GET /api/v1/tool-layer-readiness` | Core-owned Tool-layer receipt covering canonical tool dispatchability, provider layers, future-tool markers, human-checkpoint requirements, and execution-agent scope resolution. |
| `GET /api/v1/model-readiness` | Core-owned model provider and route readiness receipt covering provider status, credential availability, route coverage, blocked routes, and advisory discovery notes. |
| `GET /api/v1/model-catalog-readiness` | Core-owned model catalog receipt covering static templates, runtime module coverage, configured instance counts, and advisory live-discovery policy. Static templates stay visible when live discovery is unavailable. |

## Built-In Execution Subagents

`executor_git_manager` is the Git Manager Subagent in the execution layer. Git-related goals such as branch review, commit preparation, push readiness, worktree management, merge/rebase guidance, and user-facing handoff notes can route to it. It can explain repository state, but Git mutation and push flows must remain approval-gated through Core-governed tools such as `git_worktree_manager`.

## Event Envelope

All runtime events use:

```json
{
  "v": "1.0",
  "type": "message.created",
  "request_id": "req_xxx",
  "session_id": "sess_xxx",
  "trace_id": "trace_xxx",
  "seq": 1,
  "ts": "2026-05-18T10:15:30Z",
  "capabilities": ["agent.message"],
  "payload": {},
  "error": null
}
```

## Run Locally

```powershell
npm install
npm run restore:dotnet
npm run dev
```

The local environment currently contains `Version=V7.24.42SP3`, which breaks MSBuild version parsing. Root npm scripts remove that variable only for the child .NET process.

## Agent Debug Studio

TinadecOffice includes an **Agent Debug Studio** — a dedicated debugging tool designed for Agent systems. See [`docs/agent-debug-studio-plan.md`](agent-debug-studio-plan.md) for the full implementation plan.

### Architecture

- **C# Tracing Layer** (`src/TinadecCore/Tracing/`): OpenTelemetry-based span collection with NDJSON file export, metrics, and diagnostics.
- **Debug API** (`src/TinadecCore/Debug/`): REST endpoints for trace/metrics/diagnostics queries, plus simulation and breakpoint control.
- **WebSocket Feed** (`/api/v1/debug/ws`): Real-time span event streaming to the Debug Studio frontend.
- **Debug Studio Frontend** (`apps/desktop/src/debug/`): Electron BrowserWindow with Trace Timeline, Agent Graph Canvas, Metrics Dashboard, and Simulator Bar.

### Key API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/v1/debug/traces` | Query trace list |
| `GET /api/v1/debug/traces/{id}` | Get trace detail with span tree |
| `GET /api/v1/debug/metrics` | Query metric aggregations |
| `GET /api/v1/debug/diagnostics` | Get diagnostic report |
| `GET /api/v1/debug/processes` | Process resource info |
| `WS /api/v1/debug/ws` | Real-time debug event feed |
| `POST /api/v1/debug/simulate/message` | Inject simulated message |
| `POST /api/v1/debug/breakpoints` | Set breakpoint |

### Configuration

Tracing is configured in `appsettings.json` under `TinadecTracing` and can be overridden with environment variables:

- `TINADEC_TRACING_ENABLED` — Enable/disable tracing
- `TINADEC_TRACE_FILE` — NDJSON trace file path
- `TINADEC_OTLP_TRACES_URL` — OTLP traces export URL
- `TINADEC_OTLP_METRICS_URL` — OTLP metrics export URL
